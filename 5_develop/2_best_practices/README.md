# Best Practices

Discovering and defining the problem are practices that we already consider part of our "best-practices catalog". But when it comes to development specifically, there are some key best practices that can improve the quality of the overall solution tremendously.

Don't think of best practices as rules that must be followed, think of them as values to be cultivated.

Like safe driving, you would not take the highway with ten dogs messing around inside the car to put at risk the life of your family and the life of others just because there is no rule explicitly saying that you can't do that.

For example, at Mip Wise, we firmly believe that solutions should be reliable. So the reliability of a solution is a value that we cultivate. How?
By following best practices!

We will start discussing these best practices at a high level and then get more specific to provide extra guidance.

## Organized and Systematic (OSy)

Development is when you hand your well-defined problem over to the computer to be solved. Putting this way it may sound easier than it actually is. You know, computers are powerful, but you have to tell them *exactly* what to do. But there is so much that you have to communicate to your computer that, if you are not organized and systematic enough, you and your computer will not understand each other, which can turn out to be a catastrophe for the project.

So let's make it very clear: to develop a proper solution you must be as *organized and systematic* (OSy) as you can. Later, when someone asks you how did you build such a good solution, you can say that you were not lucky, you were OSy! ðŸ˜„

By the way, this is not a rule, this is a principle. Machines are what they are.

You might be looking around right now and wondering: *How do these guys expect me to be OSy in developing a solution if I can't even manage to keep my desk organized?*

We know how! As Tony Robbins says, we are constantly making decisions to avoid pain and have pleasure in life. If the idea of cultivating values didn't buy you, and you are thinking that being OSy is going to be painful, that's only because you have not felt the pain of debugging a messy code and the pleasure of seeing your tidy code returning reliable outputs. We will give our best to let you experience that pleasure as soon as possible, but we're also willing to let you feel the pain of dealing with a messy code if that's required for you to convince yourself how important it is to be OSy.

## Tidy, Tested, Safe (TTS)

Being organized and systematic is a high-level concept. To make it more practical and precise, let's have a look at the [Tidy, Tested, Safe][tts] (TTS) framework, which has been proposed by [Pete Cacioppi][pete], a very experienced programmer who is truly passionate about Python and solving real-world problems.

TTS provides a mental model to track key aspects of a maintainable and reliable solution. Next, we provide a quick overview of the framework. But we will dive deeper into these topics later on when it's appropriate.

* **Tidy**  
  Tidy is about organization and style. Not only does the code within a script deserves to be organized, but also the directory that hosts the script files and data, the git-flow strategy, documentation, etc. And there is no need to reinvent the wheel here, it's just a matter of following approaches that have already been proven efficient.

* **Tested**  
  To be reliable, the code must be tested. In Python especially, it's easy to implement things in a hacky way that works for a given scenario. But building an enterprise-grade application requires more than "Hey, it worked now!". In fact, the best way to efficiently and reliably test your code is by writing unit testing. And you will see that, in Python, doing automated unit testing it's much easier than it might sound.

* **Safe**  
  Even a well-written and tested code can easily break if it can't handle bad data. Naive developers will attempt to handle bad data by trying to guess what can go wrong and implementing catches to handle the exceptions they have identified. However, it's nearly impossible to predict all that can go wrong with data. So a much more systematic approach is required.

We summarize TTS with a quote from Pete:  
*Write normal Python. Automate the tests. Protect against dirty data.*
