# Output schema

We can create the output schema in exact same way that we created the input schema. Here is an example:

```python
from ticdat import PanDatFactory

output_schema = PanDatFactory(
    buy=[['Food ID'], ['Food', 'Quantity']],
    nutrition=[['Nutrient ID'], ['Nutrient', 'Quantity']])
```

We can then set data types, row predicates, and foreign key constraints, just like we did in the input schema.

We don't add a `parameters` table to the output schema, though we technically could. We adopted the convention of always keeping  it in the input schema.

Another observation is that it's not possible to set foreign key constraints between tables of different schemas. In other words, both native and foreign tables must belong to the same schema, either inputs or outputs.
