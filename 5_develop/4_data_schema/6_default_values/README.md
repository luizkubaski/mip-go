# Default values

Sometimes, you or your client might want to test the app with a dataset that has some missing data to start with. For example, imagine you want to solve the diet problem, but you still don't have food costs. Knowing that the food cost can't be `NULL`, you might want to set the cost to be $1.00 for all foods and keep moving. Of course, you could set all the values to $1.00 manually, but to make it more convenient, you can set a default value to the `Per Unit Cost` column. This way, when you upload to the app a `foods` table that has missing values in the `Per Unit Cost` column, it will automatically get filled with that default value.

It's very simple to set default values. We only need to call the `set_default_value` method of `PanDatFactory`:

```python
from ticdat import PanDatFactory

input_schema = PanDatFactory(
    parameters=[['Parameter'], ['Value']],  
    foods=[['Food ID'], ['Food Name', 'Per Unit Cost']],
    nutrients=[['Nutrient ID'], ['Nutrient Name', 'Min Intake', 'Max Intake']],
    foods_nutrients=[['Food ID', 'Nutrient ID'], ['Quantity']])

input_schema.set_default_value(table='foods', field='Per Unit Cost', default_value=1.00)
```
