# Naming conventions

Next, we explain the naming conventions we adopt for fields and tables and the reasoning behind these choices.

Before you continue, we encourage you to stop for a minute and write down a few reasons why we should adopt and follow name conventions. If you don't know where to start, think of how name conventions can save us time and create consistency.

## Display names for fields

You may have noticed in the previous session that we're using **display names** for fields, i.e., the columns of each table are named as the end-user would expect to see them on the app. In fact, later when we deploy the app on Decision Station, these will be exactly the columns' names that we will see on the app's interface.

However, if you have a compelling reason to use back-end names for columns in your app (for example, the app is built in English and you want it to be displayed in another language), then you will see later how to overwrite columns' display names.

## Backend names for tables

Why don't we use display names for tables too? We can't do that because tables will become attributes of the `input_schema` object, and as an attribute, it must follow some [Python naming conventions][python_naming_conventions]. For example, later we can do `dat.foods_nutrients` to access the *foods_nutrients* table inside our code (where `dat` is an input schema populated with data), but `dat.Foods Nutrients` would through an error.

How are tables' names displayed on Mip Hub then?

The good news is that ticdat and Mip Hub will automatically convert `foods_nutrients` into **Foods Nutrients**, for example, before it gets displayed on the app's interface. In addition, we can overwrite this automatic conversion by specifying exactly what display name we want for any given table. For example, we might want the name of the table `bom` to be displayed as **Bill of Material** rather than **BOM**. We will see how to do this type of configuration later.

  Next, you will see how to specify the data type for every field of a data schema.
