# Purpose-Built Web Applications

Development in the Mip Go program has a very clear purpose: building web applications (web apps, for short) tailored to solve specific problems.

More specifically, a web app is an application that the user can access through the internet browser and perform tasks such as uploading and editing data, configuring parameters, executing engines, visualizing and editing outputs, and analyzing scenarios.

To add more color, we ask you to read the article below, which was written by Aster Santana in 2019 (published in 2020). But before you start reading the article, let's provide some context.

Aster wrote the article while he was an employee of Opex Analytics, which was a consulting firm in the field of data analytics. Opex was one of the pioneers in delivering software, i.e., web apps, as a result of a consulting engagement. To do that, Opex had its own app deployment platform, which is referred to as *Enframe* in the article but later was renamed *OpenX*.

Also, as you will see, the article touches on many of the topics already covered in this program. So it will be a good reviewing exercise for you. In particular, Aster mention in the article three major steps to solve a business problem:

1) Understanding the problem
2) Building the solution
3) Delivering the solution to users

You can probably see how it gets mapped to the D-Wise framework. The only difference is that D-Wise has an extra item, Define, that leaves between 1) and 2).

## What if my client is not looking for a web app?

Clients might not be looking for apps because they are not aware of what an app is or how it can support their business. And even if they already recognize the benefits of an app, they might think it takes too long to build an app or that they are too expensive, as it has been historically.

But what if we told them that the extra effort to deploy an app is just a matter of setting up some configurations, something that you can do in minutes? In exchange, your client gets to see and interact with the solution before investing any resources in integrating it with their system, or doing whatever they planned to do originally. It's like having free trials of the solution, and after each trial having the option of suggesting customizations. Truly an Agile approach.

It is really possible? Our answer is: absolutely!

## Mip Hub

Mip Wise has its app deployment platform, [Mip Hub][mip-hub]. As you would expect, the extra effort to deploy an app on Mip Hub is only marginal work (actually, no extra work at all if you go with the default deployment) on top of the development of the solution engine itself and requires no knowledge about front-end development. This means that shortly you will also be deploying apps!

In addition, we not only aim to teach you to deploy custom apps, but we will also train you to develop outstanding solutions (it will just happen that they will be deployed in the form of apps). To achieve that, you will need to follow some programming best practices that we will help you to adopt and cultivate throughout this program.

In the end, the price you pay to build custom, reusable, and reliable, software in the form of a web app is to write normal and good Python code!

## Next steps

Before you move ahead, we recommend that you write down your main takeaways from Aster's article, and any other thoughts you might have. It's for your future reference. You can use the *My notes* section below as we had recommended in the [Next Steps](../../2_documentation/next_steps/README.md) section of the Documentation module.

üìù **Tip:**
*You can easily search for your notes across all modules and sections by hitting `CTRL + SHIFT + F` and typing in **my notes** or anything else that you are looking for.*
