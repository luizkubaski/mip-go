# Loading Data

To test the implementation of our data schema, we need to load data into memory and feed it into the schema.

There are many ways we can load data in Python. One classic way is to use Pandas, but we will be using ticdat because it will automatically feed the data into our defined data schema.

Using ticdat, we can load data from Excel, CSV, SQL, JSON, and Postgres databases. We will illustrate using Excel and CSV files.

## Loading data from a collection of CSV files

When reading data from CSV files, it's expected that each table defined in the schema is stored as a separated CSV file whose name matches the name of the corresponding table. In addition, the columns' names must match the fields' names defined in the schema.

If you already have your data inside the `data/inputs` directory of your package's testing directory, then go back to the `execute_locally.py` file and replace its content with the following:

```python
from mip_me import input_schema
path = "data/inputs"
dat = input_schema.csv.create_pan_dat(path)
print(dat)
```

Of course, if you are testing with your own project, you must replace `mip_me` with your project's name in the first two lines. Also, notice that we're sticking with the repository structure introduced in the [New Project][new_project] section.

If the path, tables' names, and fields' names are all correct, you will be able to execute the `execute_locally.py` file successfully.

You can also place a breakpoint next to the printing statement and execute it in debug mode. Then, in the **Variables** window, expand `dat` and click on *View as DataFrame* next to a table to visualize its data.

üìù **Tip:**
*As the name suggests, the method `create_pan_dat` creates a PanDat object, which is nothing but a collection of Pandas DataFrames. We associate to this object the variable `dat` (the abbreviation for "data") because it comes from the input schema. When it comes from the output schema, we use the variable `sln`, the abbreviation for "solution".*

## Evaluating expressions

Pycharm has a functionality called *Evaluate Expression* that is super helpful for debugging. Let's illustrate how to use it in this example.

As we know, there is a problem with the data of our 'nutrients' table. **Min Intake** is larger than **Max Intake** for Carbohydrates.

![Nutrients Table](figures/nutrients_table.png)

To see on the fly how ticdat would capture this data row failure, execute the `execute_locally.py` script in the debug mode, and once it reaches the breakpoint next to the printing statement, right-click anywhere in the editor and select **Evaluate Expression**. In the pop-up window, type in `input_schema.find_data_row_failures(dat)` and click in **Evaluate** (or hit `CTRL+ENTER`).

In the result, you will see that ticdat found a row predicate issue in the table `nutrients`, in row 1 and column 4. On Mip Hub, data integrity failures like this will be reported as nicely formatted tables.

In addition to `find_data_row_failures`, you can try `find_duplicates`, `find_data_type_failures`, and `find_foreign_key_failures`.

## Loading data from an Excel file

When reading data from XLS files, it's expected that each table defined in the schema is stored as separate sheets of the same worksheet. Again, the names of tables and fields must match those defined in the schema.

![Excel Worksheet](figures/excel_worksheet.png)

You can use the same script above to load data from XLS (or XLSX) files. You only have to replace `csv` with `xls` in the third line and change the ``path`` variable to include the name of the worksheet, along with the respective extension, `.xls` or `.xlsx`. For example:

```python
from mip_me import input_schema
path = "data/inputs/my_worksheet.xlsx"
dat = input_schema.xls.create_pan_dat(path)
print(dat)
```
