# Algorithms

Once you have modeled the problem, there are typically not a ton of algorithms you can consider. In some cases, you chose the modeling approach already thinking of the algorithm that you will be used to solve the problem.

Another common scenario is that you don't choose an algorithm itself but a tool that already has lots of algorithms implemented. The tool will then automatically make the decision for you or recommend you some options to choose from.

Again, we can't tell you how to pick the right algorithm for each problem. Whether you like it or not, there is no recipe for this. The good news is that you can always leverage our community. And we expect you to do that now by contacting your Mip Mentor. He will help you to define what to do regarding your current projects.
