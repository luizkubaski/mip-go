# Data Validation

Bad data can easily yield wrong results even through well-written code. Therefore, to be reliable, a solution must be able to catch bad data before it reaches the solution engine.

The best place to catch and handle bad data is right in the input schema.
But to achieve that, in addition to primary keys, we need to establish relationships between tables via foreign key constraints, precisely define the data type of every column, and define additional data predicates when appropriate.

The key idea here is to be as precise as you can about what you expect the data to look like. This is opposed to guessing what can go wrong with the data and adding catches for each exception.

But how can we implement this in Python?

There is a fantastic Python package called [ticdat][ticdat_website] that automates most of the work for us and is fairly simple to use!

A lot more information about data validation and best practices can be found in the [ticdat Wiki][ticdat_wiki] on GitHub.

In the *Develop* module, you will see how to implement data schemas using ticdat. But before that, there are a few more things that we need to review.
