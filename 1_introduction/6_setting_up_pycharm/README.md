# Setting Up Pycharm

Until now, you have probably been following this program on GitHub, straight from your web browser. But now it's time to change the environment. We want to make sure you get very familiar with the integrated development environment (IDE) as soon as possible, so you can start to feel the real experience of doing analytics.

## Why start from an IDE?

At first, if you are a beginner in programming, it might feel overwhelming to see so many tabs and bottoms once you launch Pycharm and open up your first project. That's why online courses will often provide you with a simple console, right there in the web browser, where you can write and execute some lines of code without worrying about anything else.

If you have watched some YouTube videos on how to program in Python, you may have gone through the exercise of writing some code in a text file that you save with a `.py` extension and then go to the command line to execute Python on it. Some others will take a step further and encourage you to use a Jupyter Notebook (which we will also do at some point, mostly for writing documentation and prototyping ideas).

We understand the motivation behind these practices. There is a very good intention to make things easier for those who are starting. The goal is to let you focus on learning the programming syntax, practicing some programming tricks, learning how to use a package, etc. We have the exact same intentions.

But there is a catch with the approaches above. The moment you feel motivated and decide to work on an actual project, perhaps your own problem, you get stuck because you realize that you can't (or it doesn't make sense to) build the whole project in a single script, and you don't know how to organize and work with multiple files!

That's one of the reasons why professional developers use an IDE like Pycharm.
Collaboration, versioning, debugging, and autocompletion, are all compelling reasons as well, but we will keep that discussion for later.

## What if I have never used an IDE like this before?

The good news is that we have figured out a way to get you started with Pycharm without you having to worry about all the complexities. And when you realize, the complexities will no longer be an issue for you. ðŸ˜‰

Therefore, you will now continue to follow the steps of this program in Pycharm!

Once in Pycharm, you will still be able to navigate this content the same way you have been doing in here. The only difference is that you are going to be working inside a professional environment where soon you will be building solutions to real-world problems.

## Installation

There are three versions of Pycharm: Professional, Community, and Edu.

We recommend the Community edition, which is free of cost and has all the functionalities we need throughout the Mip Go program and beyond.

There are very detailed installation instructions on the official webpage: <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html>

As always, if you need any help, don't hesitate in reaching out to your Mip Mentor. While it's important to spend some time trying to figure out things on your own, don't spend too much time on it because you might lose momentum.
Remember, one of the key distinctions of the Mip Go program is our support (provided by humans). So make sure to leverage that.

## Configurations

Here are some configurations that may improve your experience when reading and writing content in Pycharm.

### Change the font size

You might find it useful to be able to change the font size of the editor with `CTRL + Mouse Wheel`, just like you do on a web browser. To do that, go to `File > Settings > Editor > General` and check the appropriate boxes under the *Mouse Control* section.

### Text wrapping

It may be difficult to read the row version of a markdown that contains lengthy lines of text in it. Lengthy lines can be the result of the copy-and-paste, for example. Or if you are using a small monitor, such as on a laptop, even a line that is 60-characters long may force you to scroll left and right.

To solve this problem, as reader, go to `File > Settings > Editor > General > Soft Wraps` and check the box for "Soft-wrap these files" with "*.md" included in the list.

As an editor, you can change when and how text gets wrapped as you type it.
To do that, go to `File > Settings > Editor > General > Code Style > Markdown` and change the value of "Wrap on typing" to "Yes". You can also change the value of "Hard wrap at" to, let's say 80 if you think that the default of 120 is too long.
