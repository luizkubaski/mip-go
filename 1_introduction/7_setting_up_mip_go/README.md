# Setting Up Mip Go in Pycharm

Now that you have installed Pycharm on your computer, it's time to take Mip Go there too.

Mip Go is going to be a project in your Pycharm environment just like any other project that you will create or collaborate with in the future.

In fact, you are about to become a collaborator of the Mip Go program!
Collaborator in the sense that you will be able to make changes to the source code (i.e., the Mip Go content) and share them with us. But no worries, there is no chance that you will mess up with the content on our end because you will be working on your own version of Mip Go (if you are familiar with GitHub, you know what we're talking about).

## Cloning the Mip Go repository

Cloning a repository means that you will download a copy of the repository to your local machine and, most importantly, you can keep the version of the cloud and your local version synchronized.

So, first, launch Pycharm and click on **Get from VCS** (or **Git > Clone...** if you are already inside a project). In the dialog, enter the URL of the Mip Go repository, <https://github.com/mipwise/mip-go>, and select a folder where you will keep the local copy of the repository. To keep it standard, we recommend creating a directory called `GitHub` inside your `Documents` directory to host the project.

Once you are done, click **Clone**. If it asks you if you want to create a project from the cloned repository, select **Yes**. Then Pycharm will take care of the rest.

Not able to clone? Check ou the [Error while cloning a repository][error-cloning-a-repository].

You should now be able to see all the modules and sections of the Mip Go program under **Project** on the left.

## Resuming the training from Pycharm

Go to **mip-go > 1_introduction > 7_setting_up_mip_go** and open the `README.md` file located in there.

You will realize that each one of these sections is a `README.md` file located in a dedicated directory. When you open any of these files, you should see two side-by-side views: a raw view on the left, and a compiled view on the right. If you don't see two views, hover the cursor over the window to see three little icons in the top-right corner and select the **Editor and Preview** option.

üìù **Tip:**  
*To go back to the previously visited section/file in Pycharm, just hit `Ctrl+Tab`.*
