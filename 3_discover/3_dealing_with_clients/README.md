# Dealing with Clients

Dealing with clients can be very challenging. Especially at the beginning of the engagement when trust has not yet been established. But it can also be extremely rewarding, which is typically the case when you start to deliver results and the client start to realize the value of the solution you have built for them.

## Managing expectations

It doesn't matter how good your solution is or how much effort you have put into it, if the client's understanding of your solution is not aligned with their expectations, they will be dissatisfied. And so will you.

The best way to manage expectations is to over-communicate. It doesn't mean composing a comprehensive statement of work (SOW), although that might help. You should aim to over-communicate on a regular basis. For example, be transparent about the progress you are making, be realistic about what you want to achieve and when, share partial results, and communicate about any issues as soon as they arise.

Keep in mind that over-promising is a short-term strategy. You probably don't want to play that game. Instead, know your capabilities, know your edge, and don't fake it. If you fake your edge, sooner or later your partners and clients will feel it, and they will distrust your work and disengage with you.

Here is a funny video (or maybe not so funny given that that's the reality for many folks out there) related to this topic: [The Expert: Progress Meeting][the_expert] (3 minutes)

## Keeping the conversation focused

Sometimes it can be challenging to keep the conversation focused. There are a few traps to be aware of:

* **The client gets obsessed with details that are not very relevant:**

    In this situation, someone needs to politely drive the conversation     back to the agenda.

* **The client wants to address too many problems:**

    It's important to take notes of all the problems, but we need to make the call of which ones should be addressed now and which ones should be saved for a future iteration, or even in a future project.

* **You fell into the temptation of starting to solve the problem during the section:**

    This is a very common trap. Smart people, when they hear about a problem, they want to start solving it immediately. But if we do so, we are wasting the precious time we have to interact with the client and understand their problem. Besides, unless we are in a brainstorming section, there is no benefit in throwing up to the client the first idea that comes to our mind when we have the option to think about the problem from multiple angles offline and share only our best ideas.

## Avoiding excuses

Things will inevitably go wrong at times. When it happens, most people start looking for excuses, putting themselves in a defensive position. In some cases, people can get surprisingly creative in coming up with excuses. Don't waste your energy looking for excuses.  Instead, be transparent, be honest, look forward to finding a solution, and be proactive.
In other words, focus on the results.

## Making the client successful

**Your ultimate goal is to make the client successful, not just happy**.

Just keep in mind that making your client successful might require the courage to stand up and disagree with them.

You should always listen to what your client has to say and take that into account to making your decisions. But don't compromise the outcome of your projects by going along with the client and not leveraging your deepest wisdom and expertise.

For example, imagine that you have understood the problem, its context, goals, and requirements. After all that, you feel very convinced that Technology A is the best option to attack the problem. But when you communicate it to the client he says that you should use Technology B instead. You ask why and the client says it's because everyone is talking about Technology B these days. At that moment you could say "sure, that's fine" and please your client in the short term by doing what they want.
Alternatively, you could remember that you are the expert and start educating your client about the long-term benefits of Technology A versus the consequences of Technology B.

Perhaps it will take some time for the client to make up his mind and agree with you, or you will even lose the battle. But if you just go along with your client, you both will pay the consequences in the long run. The client will distrust you and your level of self-confidence will drop.

strategic, tactical, and operational.
