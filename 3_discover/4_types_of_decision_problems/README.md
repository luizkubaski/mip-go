# Types of Decision Problems

Business people usually classify their decision problems into three main categories within the context of an organization:

## Strategic

These are long-term sporadic decisions. For example, the organization might expect significant growth over the next 5-10 years and is planning to open new facilities. How many facilities, where, and when to build them, are examples of strategic decisions.

This type of decision involves a lot of uncertainties.

## Tactical

These are decisions that impact operations on the mid-term horizon, like weeks or months, and take place quite regularly. For example, after forecasting the demand for the upcoming weeks, a retailer needs to decide on how much to order from its suppliers.

Typically, there are uncertainties involved in tactical decisions, but they are much more manageable compared with the strategic scenario.

## Operational

Now we are talking about the type of decisions that organizations have to make on a regular basis, perhaps daily or even in intervals of minutes. In this scenario, the data might even be deterministic, but it changes very frequently.

As an example, think of a food delivery company. As new orders arrive, they have to plan for the most efficient way to deliver them on time.
