# Context

Any data analytics problem has a business context. The more we know about the context, the better positioned we will be to make the project successful. That's assuming you are not collaborating with people like Anderson is in this video: [The Expert][the_expert] (8 minutes)

In this section, we briefly discuss a few critical aspects of a business context that will help you better visualize the big picture of your next project.

## Industry

At a large scope, every analytics project belongs to an industry. A few examples of industries include retail, consumer packaged goods (CPG), logistics,  healthcare, manufacturing, financial services, and telecommunications.

Each industry has its unique ways of operating and business priorities. For example, one of the biggest priorities in the retail industry is customer fulfillment whereas the focus in the manufacturing industry is on manufacturing infrastructure. As a result, inventory allocation is more relevant for the retail industry while the manufacturing industry is more concerned with production planning and scheduling, for instance.

The good news is that we can learn all the key aspects of any given industry from the internet. And we recommend doing so as you get involved with a new project. Consider even following industry forums such as the ones below:

## Process

Processes are the means by which organizations make decisions and operate their business on a daily basis.

Analytics solutions typically use data generated by processes and output data that is somehow fed back into these processes to support decisions.

This means that knowing about the processes that your analytics solution will be supported, can help you to gain a lot of context about the problem without even taking time from your client. It may also lead you to anticipate requirements and potential issues you will face with your project.

## Stakeholders

Simply put, stakeholders are the people involved in the decision-making process of an organization. They may be CEOs, planners, sales representatives, etc.

What matters to us is that stakeholders are usually in charge of processes. And knowing that a data analytics solutions typically impact multiple processes, you should expect your solution to attract the attention of multiple stakeholders, because it might impact their working routines, metrics of measurement, and even performance outcomes.

As a result, your project might face implementation challenges beyond the technical ones. This is particularly true in big organizations. Unfortunately, there is not a lot that can be done beforehand, but building awareness on the topic may help you understand why certain decisions are taken and why certain processes are the way they are.

## IT Landscape

In this digital era, processes are run by computer systems, typically called *information technology (IT) systems*.

There are IT systems for all sorts of processes, including Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), cloud computing, and data lake.

Most likely, your data analytics solution will interact (by exchanging data) with the processes of the organization through its IT systems. Therefore, it's a good idea to have at least a high-level understanding of where your data analytics solution will fit in the IT landscape. For example, knowing sources of data helps to anticipate what type of data will be available and build integration and ingestion pipelines.

It's also important to keep in mind that IT professionals will push back solutions that may require too much integration work or maintenance.
