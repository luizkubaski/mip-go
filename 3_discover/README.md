# Discover

Welcome to the *Discover* module, which comes from the first "D" of the [D-Wise](https://www.mipwise.com/dwise) framework.

Understanding the business context and defining (to the best you can) the problem to be solved is the first step in solving any real-world problem with advanced data analytics--that's why we link most of the activities in this process to the Discover phase of the D-Wise framework. A common mistake, though, is to fall into the temptation of jumping straight to the development of the solution.

**A great solution to the wrong problem is of no use!**

This holds true whether you are collaborating with other teams inside your organization or providing consulting services for other companies.

While it may be hard (perhaps impossible) to fully understand the problem before starting working on a solution, it's crucial to ensure that we spend enough time understanding the business context and identifying goals and requirements to the best we can.

Following are three simple steps to start with:

1. **Inquire the client:**
   Listen and ask lots of questions to learn as much as you can about the problem and its context. Writing down your questions and sharing them via e-mail, for instance, may also be a good option because the client will have more time to compose a more complete answer.
2. **Take notes and summarize:**
   If you understand the problem, then you should be able to write down a short description of it along with a list of goals and requirements. But there is no need to stick with text only. Consider using tables, flow charts, examples, or anything else that would help you and your client to define the problem.
3. **Share your findings with the client:**
   By sharing your documents with the client, you get an opportunity to confirm whether your understanding of the problem is accurate enough.
   If not, the client will provide more details.

Usually, going through this exercise with the client is already a big contribution to them because it will likely help the client to have a clearer picture of their own problems. The client will surely appreciate that. In addition, this is a great way to build connections and trust with the client. As a result, the client will more likely to collaborate with you rather than burn your time by testing you and your capabilities.
