# Docstring

Docstring is used to document code. In Python, in particular, itâ€™s considered a good practice to start a function (also modules, classes, and methods) with a docstring that says what the function does, in some cases including details about inputs and outputs of the function.

We strongly encourage any aspiring Python developer to spend a time going through the [PEP 257][1] webpage to learn more about docstrings and some widely adopted conventions around how to use them. Alternatively, you can study the docstring documentation of a professional package such as Numpy or Pandas.

When docstring documentation is created according to the conventions, one can use a package such as [Sphinx][2], to generate a beautiful HTML documentation of the entire code! We will eventually come back to this.
