# Documentation

Welcome to the Documentation module!

At Mip Wise, we strongly believe that every good solution deserves to be well-documented.

However, when people think about documentation, they typically imagine a long and boring manual. As expected, not many people feel motivated to write such types of documents. But no worries, that is not the type of documentation we are talking about.

## I'm not convinced yet üòê

All right! First and foremost,
**we write documentation for ourselves and those collaborating with us.**

We got very good reasons for that:

* [X] Documentation leads us to **review, reorganize, and rethink our approach**, whether it's in the discover, define, develop, or deployment phase. As a result, we always end up with a better version of whatever we are doing after some documentation work;
* [X] Documentation help us to **share our proposed approach** with stakeholders and collaborator to collect feedback even before implementation. This exercise typically leads us to save a lot of time that otherwise would be spent in fixing or reworking the solution.
* [X] Documentation makes it much easier to **onboard new collaborators** to our project. If people can quickly understand what we are doing, they will be in a much better position to use our solution and collaborate with us;
* [X] Documentation is essential for **maintenance and future expansions a solution**. It holds true even if we, the original developers of the solution, will be the ones maintaining and expanding the solutions, because we will likely have forgotten a lot of details after a few weeks.
* [X] Documentation is also important when it comes to **sell our solution**, of course. Good documentation will make it clear what the solution is intended for and how it can be used. If it sounds difficult to use, even if it's not, people will not buy it.

We could keep adding lots of items to this list to motivate you further.
But what we want to emphasize is that writing documentation for analytics projects may be much easier than you might think.

### It's getting more interesting üôÇ

People across many communities have done a great job in developing tools to make writing documentation as convenient as possible.

We will highlight four technologies that are great examples of that:

* **Markdown:** Used for general-purpose documentation.
* **LaTeX:** Designed for typing math expressions.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Environment for writing and executing code, visualizing data, and writing documentation
* **Docstring:** The standard way of documenting code.
